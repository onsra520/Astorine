After learning that the ROG Zephyrus is the most powerful gaming laptop of all time, I feel like a king wearing royal robes whenever I take it out for breakfast in the morning. Walking down the street, even dogs look scared and do not dare to bark. In the afternoon, I dominate a few matches, and by evening, I am glowing with victory. At night, when I hit the town, girls compete to take photos with me. My exes all suddenly want to rekindle old flames. My friends look at me with respect and bow their heads in admiration. Back home, my family is proud, and the neighbors are green with envy because they know I have been a loyal Asus ROG Zephyrus fan for 20 years."
